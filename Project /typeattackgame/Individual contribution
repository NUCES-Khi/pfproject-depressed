 

There is no particular code any single member made itself , because we members used to gather after the university at our group member Ghulam Murtazaâ€™s hostel for the code creation. We all worked together during the whole code creation process. however , Naveed was particularly focused on setting and creating the interface He himself did the work of the gotoxy function. wherever you find gotoxy function in the code , it was made by Naveed, particularly Rao Ghulam, On the on the other hand, focused on the function building, whereas Ghulam Murtaza played a massive role in generating code sequences, loops, and conditions. at first we used to create our  particular part of our project code but  when we used to Gather all the things up; the code used to make no sense. although what we also did was to create code sequence by sequence, like some lines were created by one member and after that, another member created few lines of code but the best  and most effective code we made was at the hostel where we used to gather for the sake of code creation.
